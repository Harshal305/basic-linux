The Maratha Confederacy,[a] also referred to as the Maratha Empire,[12][13][14] was an early modern polity in the Indian subcontinent. It comprised the realms of the Peshwa and four major independent Maratha states[15][16] often subordinate to the former. It was established in 1674 with the coronation of Shivaji maharaj as the Maratha Chhatrapati. Marathas from the time of Shahu recognized the Mughal emperor as their nominal suzerain, similar to other contemporary Indian entities, though in practice, imperial politics at Delhi were largely influenced by the Marathas between 1737 and 1803
The Maratha Confederacy is also referred to as the Maratha Empire. Historian Barbara Ramusack 
notes, "neither term is fully accurate since one implies a substantial degree of centralisation and 
the other signifies some surrender of power to a central government and 
a longstanding core of political administrators"
